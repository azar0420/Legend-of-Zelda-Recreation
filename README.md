## Known Bugs and Problems
- Sprite layering updates needed
- Link stops walking when the room changes


## Additional Processes

- All sprites from the original game are from [Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/legendofzelda/). All team memberes created various texture atlases for all of the sprites using various photo editing tools (GIMP, Piskel, Paint.net). This cleans up the code for storing animations and allows indexing sprites by frame instead of by pixel.
- Multicolor Link sprites made by Paige. Portal Gun and Portal sprites made by Ava. Non game-original text sprites made by Sam. Among Us sprites and music made by Cadence.
